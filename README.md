Description

This is a simple command-line Bulls and Cows game written in Python.
The computer generates a random 4-digit number with unique digits, and your task is to guess it.
A bull means a correct digit in the correct position.
A cow means a correct digit in the wrong position.
The game continues until you guess the number correctly.
How to Play

Run the script:
python projekt_2.py
Enter a 4-digit number.
Digits must be unique.
The number cannot start with 0.
The game will tell you how many bulls and cows you have after each guess.
Keep guessing until you get 4 bulls.
